TASK COMPLETION : 100%

I have used MySQL hosted on XAMPP console for database as it was easiest to setup.

Kindly install xampp , run it as administrator then import my db file in Database Folder.

After that run the Node JS server .

Then finally run the angular app.

*** For File Uploading i have used multer package of Node which upload files in local project directory i.e. /src/assets/songfiles .
