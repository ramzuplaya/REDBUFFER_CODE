# AudioApp TASK COMPLETION : 100%


I have used MySQL hosted on XAMPP console for database as it was easiest to setup.

Kindly install xampp , run it as administrator then import my db file from given Database Folder.

After that run the Node JS server .

Then finally run the angular app.

For File Uploading i have used multer package of Node which upload files in local project directory i.e. /src/assets/songfiles .

# In case of any confusion please feel free to contact me.
